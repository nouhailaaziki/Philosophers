# Philosophers
A project involves simulating multiple philosophers sharing limited resources, using threads and mutexes to ensure synchronization and avoid issues like deadlocks and starvation. It focuses on multithreading and concurrency.

# The Scenario
You have N philosophers sitting at a table.

Each philosopher alternates between:
 - Thinking

 - Eating

 - Sleeping

To eat, each philosopher needs 2 forks (left and right), but there's only one fork between each pair.

Each fork is a shared resource (represented with a mutex or semaphore).

# Explanation of keys concepts
## What Are Threads?
If we don‚Äôt use threads,
our program will do things one by one‚Äîstep after step.

But when we use threads,
it‚Äôs like having friends helping you clean your house:

- One cleans the kitchen,

- One vacuums,

- You‚Äôre doing your own thing.

Everyone is doing their task at the same time!
That‚Äôs exactly what happens when you use threads:
‚úÖ Many tasks running in parallel.

## Why Do We Use Threads?
### Speed:
Tasks happen in parallel ‚Üí Program finishes faster.

### Efficiency:
Makes better use of multi-core CPUs. No wasted power!

## !! One Important Thing to Know:
Multiple threads share the same memory space.
That‚Äôs why we use something called mutex:
To make sure threads don‚Äôt step on each other‚Äôs toes
when using shared resources!

## What Is a Mutex?
A mutex (short for Mutual Exclusion) is a tool used in programming, especially in multi-threaded applications, to control access to shared resources.
The mutex lets one thread at a time
 use the resource until this thread 
is completely done with it, 
then passes it to the next thread, 
again and again, until all threads 
finish their work.
 
 ## Why Do We Need mutex?
When multiple threads work at the same time, they might access or modify the same variable or resource.
If two threads change it at the same time: Boom! Race condition. Data gets corrupted.

We use a mutex to avoid that mess by:

- Locking before accessing shared resources.

- Unlocking when done.

## Where Mutexes Work?
A mutex (mutual exclusion lock) is a synchronization tool used inside a single process.

It‚Äôs specifically used between threads within that same process.

# Explanation of some staff
### pthread_mutex_t:
is a data type in the POSIX threads library (pthread) used to represent a mutex, which is a synchronization primitive that allows threads to protect shared data from concurrent access. It is a key component in multi-threaded programming for ensuring data consistency and preventing race conditions.
### pthread_mutex_init():
function initialises the mutex referenced by mutex with attributes specified by attr. If attr is NULL, the default mutex attributes are used; the effect is the same as passing the address of a default mutex attributes object. Upon successful initialisation, the state of the mutex becomes initialised and unlocked.
### gettimeofday():
It‚Äôs a C function that grabs the current time with microsecond precision, that's why we need struct timeval because It has two fields:

     - time_t      tv_sec;   // Whole seconds since Epoch (January 1, 1970)
     - suseconds_t tv_usec;  // Microseconds (1 second = 1,000,000 microseconds) -the remaining fraction of a second
Why Use struct timeval Instead of Just time_t?
- time_t only gives seconds ‚Äî not enough if you need more precise timing.

- struct timeval gives you up to microseconds ‚Üí perfect for performance measuring, simulation timing, precise logs, etc.

Why Set the Second Argument to NULL (gettimeofday(&tv, NULL)?

That second argument is officially:

```c
struct timezone *tz;
```

BUT:

It‚Äôs an old feature from before modern time libraries existed.

Almost nobody uses struct timezone anymore.

It‚Äôs marked as obsolete in most systems.

That‚Äôs why you always set it to NULL now.

### pthread_create():

This function is from the POSIX Threads (pthreads) library.
Its job is:
Create a new thread that starts running a specific function.
Every philosopher must have one thread.
```c
pthread_create(&sim->philos[i].thread, NULL, &philosopher_routine, &sim->philos[i]
```
For each philosopher, I create a new thread using pthread_create. I give it the default settings, tell it to run philosopher_routine, and pass it a pointer to the philosopher‚Äôs own struct so it knows who it‚Äôs dealing with."

pthread_create returns:
- 0 if everything went okay.
- A non-zero error code if something went wrong.

Why Would pthread_create() Fail?

1Ô∏è‚É£ System Limit Reached.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Not Enough Resources.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Invalid Attributes (rare here since we use NULL).

4Ô∏è‚É£ Invalid Arguments.

### pthread_join(): 
Blocks the specified thread until other threads finish their routine.
waits for all threads that were successfully created .

### pthread_mutex_destroy():
It frees the system resources that were reserved for that mutex.

It‚Äôs like saying:

‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm done using this lock, the program doesn‚Äôt need it anymore. Clean it up.‚Äù

Why Is It Important?
When you‚Äôre finished using mutexes (e.g., end of your program, simulation is over).

Mutexes are managed by the OS; if you don‚Äôt destroy them, you might leave behind unnecessary resources or memory usage.

That‚Äôs especially relevant if you create a lot of mutexes dynamically

# BONUS Part: Philosophers Using Processes and Semaphores
## What‚Äôs Different?
In the bonus version, instead of using threads, we use processes and semaphores.

## What Is a Process?
A process is an independent program instance with its own memory.

Unlike threads:

Processes don‚Äôt share memory.

Safer but more expensive (more system resources).

Each philosopher becomes a separate process.

## Threads vs Processes: The Key Differences

| Feature                | **Threads**                                                    | **Processes**                                                  |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**         | A lightweight unit of execution within a **single process**     | A heavyweight, independent instance of a **program**           |
| **Memory Space**       | **Shared memory** among threads                                 | **Separate memory** for each process                           |
| **Creation Speed**     | Faster (lighter, less overhead)                                 | Slower (heavier, more setup)                                   |
| **Communication**      | Easy via **shared variables**                                   | Requires **IPC** (e.g., pipes, semaphores, shared memory)      |
| **Crash Impact**       | If one thread crashes, **it may affect the whole process**      | If one process crashes, **others remain unaffected**           |
| **Isolation**          | Low ‚Äî shared memory means less safety                           | High ‚Äî processes are isolated and safer                        |
| **Resource Usage**     | Less (shares memory and code)                                   | More (each has its own memory and code)                        |
| **Use Case (Philo)**   | Used in the **mandatory part**                                  | Used in the **bonus part**                                     |
| **Synchronization Tool**| **Mutexes** (for shared data protection)                      | **Semaphores** (for inter-process communication)               |
| **Scheduling**         | Handled by the OS scheduler; usually **faster to context switch** | Also scheduled by OS; **heavier context switch**             |

## What Is a Semaphore?
A semaphore is like a traffic light üö¶.

It controls access to a resource by keeping a counter.

When the counter is above 0 ‚Üí access allowed.

When it hits 0 ‚Üí new processes must wait.

## Why Use Semaphores?
Since processes don‚Äôt share memory like threads, we need another way to coordinate access to shared things (like forks, printing to stdout).

Semaphores allow us to:

Let only a limited number of philosophers pick up forks.

Avoid deadlocks (by limiting access or ordering who eats).

Sync outputs (so logs don‚Äôt print at the same time).

## If you don‚Äôt use semaphores with multi-processes:
 ### 1. CRASH or behave unpredictably
Processes do not share memory like threads.

So without semaphores, each philosopher process works blindly, without knowing what the others are doing.

They‚Äôll:

Pick up the same forks at the same time

Overlap prints

Mess up death detection and eating counts

 ### 2. Forks won‚Äôt be protected (‚Üí double grabbing)
Each philosopher will try to access the shared forks variable directly.

This causes multiple philosophers to grab the same fork at the same time, because there‚Äôs no protection mechanism.

- Result: Unrealistic or broken simulation ‚Äî sometimes a philosopher eats without two forks, which breaks the logic.

### Final Answer:
If you don‚Äôt use semaphores in the bonus part, your program will break.
You‚Äôll face:

- Race conditions

- Data corruption

- Deadlocks

- Garbage output

- Memory leaks

- Failed logic

Semaphores are not optional in the bonus part ‚Äî they are the backbone of inter-process coordination.

## Mutex vs Semaphore: The Key Differences

| Feature           | Mutex                                                      | Semaphore                                                         |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Basic Idea**    | A lock used to protect a single shared resource            | A signaling mechanism to manage access to multiple instances of a resource |
| **Value Range**   | Only 0 or 1 (locked/unlocked)                              | Any non-negative integer ‚â• 0                                       |
| **Ownership**     | Only the thread that locks it can unlock it               | Any process/thread can increment or decrement it                   |
| **Use Case**      | Synchronizing threads within the same process              | Synchronizing multiple processes or threads                        |
| **Deadlock Risk** | Higher if not used carefully                               | Less direct, but misuse can still cause issues                     |
| **Blocking Behavior** | Blocks other threads if already locked               | Blocks when the value is 0                                         |
| **Shared Memory?**| No (used inside a process with shared memory)              | Yes (can be used across multiple processes)                        |

## Common Semaphores in Bonus
sem_forks: Limits access to the forks.

sem_print: Prevents printing overlap.

sem_meal_check: Ensures accurate monitoring of meals.

## Bonus Considerations
Use fork() to create philosopher processes.

Set up and unlink semaphores properly to avoid memory leaks.

Handle signals and child process termination gracefully.
